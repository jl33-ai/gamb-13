Probabilistic Adrenaline 

### Brainstorm ðŸ§ :
- I just realised this wonâ€™t work, if thereâ€™s only a positive incentive for high E(V) and no consequence for low E(V), people are just gonnaâ€¦ ah.
  - Must be averaged over every run from a given player. So it's truly E(V) - maybe a practice mode.
  - It needs that one genuinely special, addictive **thing**. 

- Enter name to Submit score
  - E(V) (primary ranking)
  - Var: (secondary ranking and attached to every E(V))
- Math Qâ€™sâ€¦
- fun, simple betting games
- Bitcoin on the line. 
- Graphing mechanism: simply an time series where the next things are being continually generated based on parameters, the grapher plots a specific interval of it (n-50 to n)
- The parameters which influence the movement price at time n+1
  - Seasonal trends
  - Player input (through minigames etc) 
  - Randomness
    - News
- you get bonuses based on how quickly you can type out the answer '34' , or maybe like a sequence of 3. time taken: 12.39s,
- math q's/raw intuition, logic/approximations and you get to bet a % of your portfolio on it.
- which square flashed green?
- Blender Render
- Loss minimisation, high pressure, screen flashing, your portfolio starts crashing crashing crashing and you have to answer math/logic questions quickly to stop it from doing so (stops crashing once you get X correct)
- Social media feed
- Global leaderboard - playerID
- Try to it low variance (less sensitive to just having a lucky run and as skill based as possible - like gambling) 
- Random charts (ASCII) - need a really good engine for this; and then the engine which determines the t+1 direction
- Raise the odds by answering mental arithmetic ie 
- Like the optiv one
- The market is raising 15 mod 4 points 
- Make it more addictive
- random news with a (hidden) associated influence
- - Games: blackjack, where you just wanna go as high as possible (could show a physical representation), and the uniform distritbution that it comes from. Same game, but the numbers are sampled from a normal 
- Then: Poker, where you can trade your current pot w/ bots who have the same amount as you +/- some random amount
- Then: a live trading game w/ the chart and you have to 
- 5 gamemodes max
- And then â€™Tishagiâ€™s Casinioâ€™ where you do all games in one run. But itâ€™s like a live trading sim and (ASCII castle). "are you sure you're ready to enter" - this is the main gamemode, the others exist as sides. So compartmentalise into functions poker(stake, parameters) return score
- At the end: a 0 E(X) thing where itâ€™s like 0.25 chance to x4
- 10 different summary types based on dictionairy mapping.
- Quantify risk aversion
- quantiy mental arithmetic score
- Quantify probability etc...
- make super simple, coherent, flow
- Make it accessible
- Always ends with a 1/13 chance of halving everything, for 2x portfolio (obviously positive E(V) but a test of rationality)
- Exploration of random number generator. Uniform -> distribution (memorise)
