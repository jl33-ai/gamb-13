Probabilistic Adrenaline 

### Brainstorm:
- Enter name to Submit score
- E(V) 
- Var: 
- Math Q’s…
- you get bonuses based on how quickly you can type out the answer '34' , or maybe like a sequence of 3. time taken: 12.39s,
- Loss minimisation, high pressure, screen flashing, your portfolio starts crashing crashing crashing and you have to answer math/logic questions quickly to stop it from doing so (stops crashing once you get X correct)
- Global leaderboard - playerID
- Random charts (ASCII) 
- Raise the odds by answering mental arithmetic ie 
- Like the optiv one
- The market is raising 15 mod 4 points 
- Make it more addictive
- - Games: blackjack, where you just wanna go as high as possible (could show a physical representation), and the uniform distritbution that it comes from. Same game, but the numbers are sampled from a normal 
- Then: Poker, where you can trade your current pot w/ bots who have the same amount as you +/- some random amount
- Then: a live trading game w/ the chart and you have to 
- 5 gamemodes max
- And then ’Tishagi’s Casinio’ where you do all games in one run. But it’s like a live trading sim and (ASCII castle). "are you sure you're ready to enter"
- At the end: a 0 E(X) thing where it’s like 0.25 chance to x4
- 10 different summary types based on dictionairy mapping.
- Quantify risk aversion
- quantiy mental arithmetic score
- Quantify probability etc...
- make super simple, coherent, flow
- Make it accessible
- Always ends with a 1/13 chance of losing everything, for 2x portfolio (obviously positive E(V) but a test of rationality)
- Exploration of random number generator. Uniform -> distribution (memorise)
